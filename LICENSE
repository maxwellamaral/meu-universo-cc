   individually chosen by them.

i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
   Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March

         and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

  2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
     based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Adapted
     Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by
     providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

  3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
     by Section 3(a)(1)(a) to the extent reasonably practicable.

b. ShareAlike.

In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material,

     as published by Creative Commons from time to time.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

   reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
   the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database
   in a database to which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
   in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
   is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
   substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of
   doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under
   this Public License.

   THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF

   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR
   OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR
   NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE
   TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) FOR
   ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY,
   OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE
   OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS
   DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
   licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
   Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a),
   it reinstates:
    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
